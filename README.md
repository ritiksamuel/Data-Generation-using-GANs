<H1 ALIGN=CENTER> GENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL NETWORKS (GANs) </H1>
Creating a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) involves training a generator and a discriminator simultaneously, where the generator learns to generate realistic data while the discriminator learns to distinguish between real and generated data.

## ABOUT
This project is focused on developing a GAN-based deepfake detection system. The primary goal is to create a tool capable of identifying and distinguishing between real and AI-generated (deepfake) content, specifically in videos or images. With the rise of manipulated media, deepfake detection has become crucial for media integrity, security, and user trust. GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) play a dual role in this project: while theyâ€™re commonly used to generate realistic fake images and videos, their underlying mechanics can also aid in detecting such synthetic content.

The project involves training a model to recognize subtle inconsistencies that often appear in deepfake media, such as unnatural artifacts, irregular facial expressions, or abnormal pixel patterns. The system's workflow typically involves preprocessing input videos or images, feeding them into the detection model, and outputting a probability score or classification indicating the likelihood of a deepfake.

The end result is a web-based application where users can upload videos for deepfake detection, aimed at empowering individuals, media companies, and organizations to protect themselves from deceptive content.

## FEATURES

### Generative Capabilities: 
GANs can generate high-quality synthetic data samples that resemble real data, such as images, text, and music.

### Unsupervised Learning: 
GANs operate without explicit labels during training, making them suitable for unsupervised learning tasks like data generation and anomaly detection.

### Diversity in Output:
GANs can produce diverse outputs by exploring different regions of the data distribution, enabling creativity and variability in generated content.

### Transfer Learning: 
Pre-trained GAN models can be fine-tuned or used as feature extractors for downstream tasks, leveraging the learned representations for improved performance.

### Robustness and Stability: 
Advances in GAN architectures and training techniques have improved stability and convergence, addressing challenges such as mode collapse and training instability.

## REQUIRMENTS
